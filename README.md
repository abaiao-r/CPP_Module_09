## Introduction

Module 09 focuses on utilizing the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. It covers various exercises that involve working with containers, algorithms, and more.

## General Rules

- Compiling: Compile your code with `c++` and the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. Your code should still compile if you add the flag `-std=c++98`.
- Formatting and naming conventions: Follow the provided guidelines for naming files, classes, functions, and member functions.
- Allowed/Forbidden: You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library, but external libraries like C++11 and Boost are forbidden.

## Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange

### Introduction

This exercise involves creating a program that outputs the value of a certain amount of bitcoin on a specific date. It utilizes a database in CSV format to represent bitcoin prices over time.

### Relevance

This exercise emphasizes file handling, input validation, and working with external data sources.

### Key Concepts

- File Input/Output
- Data Parsing
- Error Handling

## Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation

### Introduction

In this exercise, it was created a program that evaluates mathematical expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). The program takes an RPN expression as an argument and outputs the correct result.

### Relevance

This exercise focuses on algorithmic thinking and stack-based calculations.

### Key Concepts

- Stack Data Structure
- Mathematical Operations
- Error Handling

## Exercise 02: PmergeMe

### Introduction

This exercise involves implementing the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort a positive integer sequence. The program must display the unsorted and sorted sequences, along with the time taken by the algorithm.

### Relevance

This exercise reinforces understanding of sorting algorithms and their efficiency.

### Key Concepts

- Sorting Algorithms
- Time Complexity Analysis
- Algorithm Efficiency
