## Introduction

Module 09 focuses on utilizing the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. It covers various exercises that involve working with containers, algorithms, and more.
Definitions of containers and algorithms are as follows:

- **Containers**: A container is a holder object that stores a collection of other objects (its elements). They are implemented as class templates, which allows a great flexibility in the types supported as elements. The container manages the storage space for its elements and provides member functions to access them, either directly or through iterators (reference: [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl/)).

- **Algorithms**: Algorithms are functions that operate on ranges of elements. These operations include initializing, sorting, searching, and transforming (reference: [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/)).

The STL is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of robust C++ programs. It provides a wide variety of containers and algorithms that can be used to solve various problems. Containers allow for the storage of data, while algorithms allow for the manipulation of data. The STL is a great resource that can be used to create efficient and effective C++ programs.

To better follow the exercises, it is recommended to use the [en.subject.pdf](subject.pdf).


## Exercise 00: Bitcoin Exchange

### Introduction

This exercise involves creating a program that outputs the value of a certain amount of bitcoin on a specific date. It utilizes a database in CSV format to represent bitcoin prices over time.

### Relevance

This exercise emphasizes file handling, input validation, and working with external data sources.

### Key Concepts

- File Input/Output
- Data Parsing
- Error Handling

## Exercise 01: Reverse Polish Notation

### Introduction

In this exercise, it was created a program that evaluates mathematical expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). The program takes an RPN expression as an argument and outputs the correct result.

### Relevance

This exercise focuses on algorithmic thinking and stack-based calculations.

### Key Concepts

- Stack Data Structure
- Mathematical Operations
- Error Handling

## Exercise 02: PmergeMe

### Introduction

This exercise involves implementing the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort a positive integer sequence. The program must display the unsorted and sorted sequences, along with the time taken by the algorithm.

### Relevance

This exercise reinforces understanding of sorting algorithms and their efficiency.

### Key Concepts

- Sorting Algorithms
- Time Complexity Analysis
- Algorithm Efficiency

## Conclusion

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful tool that allows for the creation of robust C++ programs. It provides a wide variety of containers and algorithms that can be used to solve various problems. Containers allow for the storage of data, while algorithms allow for the manipulation of data. The STL is a great resource that can be used to create efficient and effective C++ programs.
